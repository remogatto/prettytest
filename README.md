# Features

PrettyTest main features are:

  * A simple assertion vocabulary for better readability
  * Customizable formatters through interfaces
  * It's integrated with the go test command
  * It has pretty and colorful output with reports

# Quick start

~~~go
package foo

import (
	"github.com/remogatto/prettytest"
	"testing"
)

// Start of setup
type testSuite struct {
	prettytest.Suite
}

func TestRunner(t *testing.T) {
	prettytest.RunWithFormatter(
		t,
		new(prettytest.TDDFormatter),
		new(testSuite),
	)
}
// End of setup


//your tests start here
func (t *testSuite) TestTrueIsTrue() {
	t.True(true)
}

func (t *testSuite) TestEquality() {
	t.Equal("awesome", "awesome")
}

//failing test
func (t *testSuite) TestInequality() {
	t.NotEqual("awesome", "awesome")
}
~~~

Then, to run the tests simply use the the go test command:

~~~bash
$ go test

testSuite:
	OK		TestEquality		(1 assertion(s))
	FAIL	TestInequality		(1 assertion(s))
	OK		TestTrueIsTrue		(1 assertion(s))

3 tests, 2 passed, 1 failed, 0 pending
--- FAIL: TestFoo (0.00 seconds)
prettytest.go:221: 	Expected awesome but got awesome -- /home/minhajuddin/s/gotest/foo_test.go:34
		FAIL
exit status 1
PASS
